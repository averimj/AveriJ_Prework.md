### CHECKLIST MANIFESTO
As a new student and future developer, I believe having a checklist will help me stay on task. When I write stuff down (a checklist), it helps lessen my anxiety because I know what to expect and what needs to be done. 

As a human being, I'm guaranteed to make mistakes and forget things but if I have my responsibilities written down, it also guarantees that everything gets done.

For me, checklist are similar to how I set goals. Let's say my goal is to lose 20 pounds. It sounds good and its a very general statement but I have to be specific about how I plan to lose 20 pounds. 

The "How" is essentially my checklist.
- [ ] Drink 4 bottles of water
- [ ] Take the stairs at work
- [ ] Zumba on Tuesdays and Thursday from 6pm- 7pm
- [ ] Run for 30 minutes on Saturday


### 29 BEHAVIORS OF UNSTOPPABLE PROGRAMMERS
My top 3 behaviors are: 
* Use Google when struck...I've been learning on my own and when I get stuck I go straight to Google. I've found it to be really helpful when I know how to correctly word my question. The flip side is that sometimes I find myself searching on Google for hours on end. I need to know when to let it go.

* Always code review your own work first...It seems like common sense but it would avoid someone else having to go thru and correct silly mistakes that you could've fixed on your own. 

* Go play foosball. That's often more important than coding...Sometimes I can be so focused and don't want to get out of my groove. But studies have shown that a break every 90 minutes is healthy.  


### STRENGTH BASED APPROACH
#### What is your impression of strengths-based development? What questions do you have about this kind of development?
My impression of Strength Based Development is that companies figure out what a persons strengths are and capitalize on it. Literally bringing out the best in people and helping individuals realize their innate abilities and hone in on them.
In addition, if a person feels valued within an organization, I believe they'll work harder and more creatively because they're given the space and support to do so.

#### What do you feel are your top strengths? How do you know?
My top strengths are patience, kindness, a great listener, an easy/go with the flow attitude and I'm determined. I know this to be true because I'm self aware and I recently took the Pairin Personal Assessment and it listed me as:
* Dynamo
* Tugboat
* Calm, Cool and Collected
* Lover of Moderation

I also know my weakness is dealing with conflict. I often ask myself if I've adapted these strenghts to somehow protect myself by avoiding conflict.

#### How do you hope to develop your strengths for your new career in software development?
Using my strengths as a software developer will be most evident when working with teams. I notice who the introverts are in the room and  create an environment where all people feel comfortable, a place where they know their valued and respected for their individuality.

#### What role does empathy play in your life and how has it helped you?
Depending on the environment, I can be introverted. I want to interact with the group but unsure how, so instead I observe. When someone in the group ask my opinion or how I'm doing I appreciate it. I feel valued, I feel noticed and want to contribute

#### How does empathy help you build better software?
When you're able to design products based on what the users want and need. And you know their wants and needs by actively listening to them and/or going out into the field and watching how they use the product.

#### Why is empathy important for working on a team?
When working on a team, you're working with people from different cultures, personalities and perspectives on the world. Hearing everyones opinion on the matter is important because they might see something that no one else sees or thought of. And making sure everyone in the team is heard is valuable. 

#### Describe a situation in which your ability to empathize with a colleague or teammate was helpful.
Knowing that I sometimes lean toward the introvert side, I push myself to speak up and call on my fellow introverters who we haven't heard from. I understand first hand that just because they haven't said anything doesn't mean they don't have anything to say.

#### When do you find it most difficult to be empathetic in professional settings? How can you improve your skills when faced with these scenarios? 
I struggle with people who always complain, people who are constantly playing the victim role and don't take responsibility for their actions/role. I can improve my skills by simply accepting them for who they are. Some people crave attention because they didn't get it as a child and its hard to see that when you have this ADULT infront of you constantly whinning. I've had times in my life when I blamed others for the situations I found myself in and I truly thought they were to blame and failed to realize the active role I played. But I was completely clueless to this fact. Just coming from a place of understanding.

### POMODORO BREAK
The Pomodoro Break is a time management technique developed by Francesco Cirillo in the mid 1980's. He used a timer (shaped like a tomato, hence the name pomodoro) to break down his work into 25 minute intervals. These intervals are called pomodoro and were separated by 3-5 minute breaks. After 4 pomodoro's, you're suppose to take a 15-30 minute break and then start over.

Personally, I like to work for 90 minutes with a 10-15 minute break. During the break I like to take a walk outside to get some fresh air and a bit of nature.
